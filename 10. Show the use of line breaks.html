    <h1>Using Line Breaks in HTML</h1>

    <p>This is the first line.<br>
    This is the second line, which appears after a line break.<br>
    And this is the third line after another break.</p>

    <p>Here is a sentence without a break. It continues on the same line.</p>

    <p>Poetry often uses line breaks:<br>
    Roses are red,<br>
    Violets are blue,<br>
    HTML is fun,<br>
    And so are you!</p>
