    <p>
        This is an example of a floating image. The image floats to the left of this text, allowing the text to wrap around it. 
        You can add more text here to see how the layout adjusts. 
        Floating images are useful for creating visually appealing layouts without needing to use complex positioning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Continue to add more content here. The text will continue to flow around the floating image.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can also have more paragraphs and content below the floating image. 
        When the text is longer, it will still wrap around the floated image until the end of the section.
